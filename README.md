py register_domain.py --purchase        # actual registration (already done)
py finalize_dns.py                       # poll for fraud clearance, then swap NS to Cloudflare + email Peter
py send_status_email.py                  # one-off build report email
```

## Activating "Pete's Lead" forward to a tenant

When you find the contractor renting the site, set these Netlify env vars (Site &rarr; Settings &rarr; Environment variables) — **no code change needed**:

| Var | Example | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER` | `+61412345678` | E.164 number of the contractor — the destination of the forwarded call |
| `TENANT_LABEL` | `Pete's Lead` (default) | The phrase whispered to the contractor before they're connected |
| `TENANT_BRAND` | `Gold Coast Pool Builders` (default) | What plays after the label — full whisper is `"Pete's Lead. Pete's Lead from Gold Coast Pool Builders."` |

After setting `TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER`, all inbound calls:
1. Telnyx fetches `/voice` → sees the env var is set → returns dial-with-whisper XML
2. Caller hears ringing while contractor's phone rings
3. Contractor picks up &rarr; hears the whisper &rarr; speaks to caller
4. After the call, you get an email confirming the lead was forwarded + talk time
5. If the contractor doesn't pick up within 22 seconds, it falls through to voicemail (you still get the recording email)

To stop forwarding: delete `TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER` (or set it empty). Calls revert to voicemail-only.

To set the env var via API instead of dashboard:

```bash
NETLIFY_TOKEN=$(cat credentials/NETLIFY_API_TOKEN.txt)
ACCOUNT="6854b409e037d5cc38ff961e"
SITE="a811f4bf-4aff-4e36-86d0-6ceee2650200"
curl -s -X POST "https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT/env?site_id=$SITE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NETLIFY_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"key":"TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER","values":[{"value":"+61412345678","context":"all"}]}]'
```

## To-do once domain clears fraud check

1. `py finalize_dns.py` will swap NS automatically and email Peter.
2. Verify SSL (Netlify auto-provisions via Let's Encrypt).
3. Submit to Google Search Console (`sc-domain:goldcoastpoolbuilders.com.au`).
4. Set up Google Business Profile (needs registered business name "Gold Coast Pool Builders" first).
5. Backlink work: hipages directory, True Local AU, Yelp AU, Cardinia Shire community pages.
6. Shortlist 2–3 retaining wall contractors in Pakenham; pitch the leads with a $1,500–$2,500/mo exclusive retainer.

## Niche-fit notes

| Factor | Why this niche |
|---|---|
| Local fit | Pakenham/Cockatoo estates are sloped — demand is structural, not weather-cyclical |
| Competition | Mostly generic landscapers, no specialist site dominates the local SERP |
| Job value | $5K–$30K average; tenant happily pays $1,500–$2,500/mo |
| Resilience | Permit-driven, year-round, less seasonal than tree services |
| Phone-driven | Customers call before email for site visits |
